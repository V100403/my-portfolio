    <h2>Internship Experience</h2>
    <p>I interned at the Centre for Innovative and Lifelong Learning (CILL) where I explored educational technologies like Wooclap and Canva.</p>
    <p>I designed tutorials with AI voiceovers and soft background music to help lecturers integrate tools into their teaching. These included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to use Wooclap and create polls</li>
      <li>Integrating Wooclap into presentations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also created visually rich diagrams for blended learning and reflective models like Gibbs and John's. View my materials here:</p>

    <p>I’ve learned to collaborate, lead, and solve problems with creativity. As I move into the professional world, I remain committed to lifelong learning and am excited to tackle new challenges in web and multimedia development.</p>
