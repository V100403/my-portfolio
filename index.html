      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Web and Multimedia Development student at the University of Mauritius. When I first joined, I was shy and introverted, but I was determined to step out of my comfort zone and become more social and involved on campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began my campus involvement by joining the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) as Graphics Lead, where I developed promotional materials and contributed to event communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after, I joined Rays Club, progressing through the roles of Multimedia Coordinator, Head of Multimedia Coordinators, Secretary, and currently Vice President. In these roles, I led the multimedia team for major events such as the Mr and Miss UoM pageant, organizing and delegating tasks while mentoring teammates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I became involved with the Multimedia Society, serving as Secretary from Year 1 through Year 2, managing communications, meetings, and club activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also completed my placement at the Centre for Innovative and Lifelong Learning (CILL), where I developed AI-narrated interactive video tutorials for educational tools, gaining valuable practical experience in multimedia development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these experiences, I have grown my leadership, communication, and organizational skills, while nurturing my passion for design. I aspire to become a UI/UX Designer, creating meaningful and engaging digital experiences centered around users.
